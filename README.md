# Raspa

We believe that a huge leap towards making cities smarter can be made by optimizing the usage of public and private resources by ordinary citizens. With this objective, we have developed our website -Raspa, an internet based product that aims to incentivize public citizens to pool in their resources and reduce the clutter caused by overload of public and private resources (transport, utilities, working and living spaces, maintenance, etc.).
Raspa works on the concept of 'Smart Points', where citizens will be credited RSPs based on the resources they offer for pooling, resources that get shared by other citizens, and initiatives taken towards promotion of RSP concept by the citizens. The RSPs can be 'redeemed' by the users against GovCash (a voucher that can be used against payments made for Government services), Tax Credits (redeem Smart Points and get Tax Refunds), Cash (Get a percentage of cash transferred to bank account) etc.
We believe that this will go a long way in making cities smarter and helping the city authorities optimize the resource allocation among the public, and thus move towards an optimal Smart City concept.
